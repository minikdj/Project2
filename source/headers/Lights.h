* Base struct for all types of lights.Supports only specification of the

* positional, directional, and spot lights.
*
* Instances of this struct an be used to simulate only ambient light.Ambient
* light is described as bounced light that has been scattered so much that it
* is impossible to tell the direction to its source.If using a LightSource
* instantiation to simulate ambient light, the overall intensity of the light
* should be low in order to avoid washing out shadows as well as diffuse and
* specular effects that can be achieved when using children of this struct.
